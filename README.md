AI & Data Visualization Project

This repository contains multiple small projects and experiments that explore different machine learning models, deep learning architectures, and visualization techniques. Each folder in this repo focuses on a specific topic or model.

üìÇ Project Contents

RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)

Implementation of basic RNN models.

Covers sequence modeling tasks and time-series data.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)

Advanced recurrent models designed to capture long-term dependencies.

Applications include text generation and sequential prediction.

MNIST

Classification of handwritten digits using deep learning models.

Experiments with CNNs, RNNs, and hybrid models on the MNIST dataset.

Data Visualization

Visual representation of datasets and model results.

Uses libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights.

Audio Visualizer

Transforms audio signals into visual patterns.

Includes waveform, spectrogram, and frequency-domain visualizations.

TensorFlow Projects

Implementations of machine learning and deep learning models using TensorFlow.

Covers both beginner and intermediate-level examples.
